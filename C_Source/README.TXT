  With the exception of the files in tccfiles.zip, these
  examples are all for Microsoft C (I used ver 8). I did one
  example in tccfiles.zip for Turbo C. See notes below and
  in each of the source files for how to compile.

  tut2.c
  10/30/94
  from tutprog2.pas
  Adapted from Denthor's tutprog2.pas
  Translated into C, from Denthor's VGA Trainer, by
  Steve Pinault, scp@ohm.att.com
  Compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5 (Microsoft C 8.0)
  To compile:
  First compile the subroutines in tutsubs.c with the batch file 
  cltutsub.bat
  Then compile any of the tutor programs with the batch file
  cltut.bat
  Example: C:>cltutsub
           C:>cltut tut2.c
           to compile the program tut2.exe.
  I compiled and ran all of these on my computer (a 486DX2) and they
  worked for me; that's all I can say!
