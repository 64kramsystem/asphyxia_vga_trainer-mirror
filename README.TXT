Hello there.

My name is Denthor (Grant Smith) of the South African demo group ASPHYXIA.
This is a trainer that have been writing on and off for the last few months
in order to help out budding young graphics programmers. Currently there are
nine tutorials in all, each with a text file and accompianing pascal source
file. Also included are two or three "bonus" pascal files with various
effects.

I have left the files in their origional form, so they contain some local
stuff which you can ignore.

PLEASE LEAVE A RESPONSE! Any comments/criticisms/flames/suggestions etc are
very welcome (I love getting mail!)

Leave all comments to   smith9@batis.bis.und.ac.za

Hope to hear from you soon!
